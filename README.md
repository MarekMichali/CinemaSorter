# CinemaSorter
 The project was made during the first semester at the Silesian University of Technology.  

Reads in from one file the cities where the cinemas and their repertoires are located and then creates for each city a file with the repertoire sorted chronologically.  
The name of the input file is given as an argument to the program call.

Input file format:  
City	Title	dd.mm.yyyy	hh:mm
